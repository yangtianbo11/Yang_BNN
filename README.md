Bayesian Neural Network

- Implemented a closed form approach to Bayesian sequential learning that requires no expensive gradient calculations and used the novel algorithm to train several neural networks using synthetic data and found convergence in predicted values.
- Generalized Marco Huber’s result in 2020 to a fully connected neural network for multiclass classification.
- Resulted in a research paper titled “Classified as known: A novel Bayesian Neural Network”.
